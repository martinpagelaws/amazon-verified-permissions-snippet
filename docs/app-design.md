# Simple Posts App Design

* any authenticated user can publish text snippets, called posts
* any authenticated user can see all the posts that have been published on the platform
* post owners can delete posts
* post owners can update posts
* users can have an "appRole" attribute: admin
* users with the admin appRole can delete any post. But they cannot create any.
